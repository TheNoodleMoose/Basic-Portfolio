            <p>My name is Christian Huffman and I am in the process of becoming a full-stack developer! In high school, I discovered
                my passion for coding! It started out with simple arduino robots, programming them to navigate through a maze. At that moment
            I realized the power of code. I eventually dove into the world of HTML and CSS and things began to click even more. 
            We use the internet every to view and learn new things, and to be able to apart of that and create is amazing!</p> 
            <p>Ever since then I have had the desire to become a web developer! I love coding, video games, and learning!
                Coding and learning are a true passion of mine. I don't think there is anything more important than education and learning new things.
                And when I combine that with coding and web development I get something that I want to do for the rest of my life! I cannot
                wait to learn more and devlop some awesome projects! I WILL become a full-stack developer!</p>
