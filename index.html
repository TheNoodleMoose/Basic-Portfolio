        <p>My name is Christian Huffman and I am in the process of becoming a full-stack developer! In high school, I discovered
            my passion for coding!</p> 
        <p>Ever since then I have had the desire to become a web developer! I love coding, video games, and learning!
            Coding and learning are a true passion of mine. I don't think there is anything more important than education and learning new things.
            And when I combine that with coding and web development I get something that I want to do for the rest of my life! I cannot
            wait to learn more and devlop some awesome projects!</p>
